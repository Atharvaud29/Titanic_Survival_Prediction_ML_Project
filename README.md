# Titanic_Survival_Prediction_ML_Project
The Titanic survival prediction project is a classic machine learning problem where the goal is to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, ticket class, and more.
The dataset used in this project typically contains information about passengers who were aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.
The goal of the project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not based on the available features. The model can then be used to predict the survival of passengers in other similarÂ situations.
